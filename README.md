# About the Repo
This is a collection of all the assignments and final project for the graduate course Introduction to Machine Learning offered at Concordia during the Fall 2022 academic semester. You will find within this repo some descriptions and project notes. Below we provide a brief summary of the project. 

## Comparison of Classification Techniques for Fraud Detecting Among Credit Card Transactions
* The main purpose of this project is meant to compare various classification techniques and compare their performance. 
* Firstly the dataset must be downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. 
* Then the model is trained using different classifiers to determine if a transaction is indeed fraudulent or not. The classifiers compared were:
  * Gaussain Mixture Model (GMM)
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  * Logistic Regression
  * Naive Bayesian (Gaussian
